# ASCII Creatures Adventure - How to Play

## Starting the Game

Run the game with:
```bash
python3 ascii_rpg.py
```

## Game Overview

You're a creature trainer exploring a world filled with wild creatures. Your goal is to catch creatures, battle them, and defeat the final boss!

## Controls

- **W** - Move Up
- **A** - Move Left
- **S** - Move Down
- **D** - Move Right
- **Q** - Quit Game

## Map Legend

- `@` - Your character
- `#` - Walls/Mountains (can't walk through)
- `.` - Safe paths
- `"` - Grass (wild creature encounters!)
- `~` - Water (can't walk through)
- `H` - Healing House (restore HP and items)
- `B` - Boss Area (final challenge!)

## Battle System

When you encounter a wild creature in the grass, you'll enter battle mode with 4 options:

1. **Fight** - Attack the wild creature
2. **Catch** - Use a Pokeball to catch it (easier when HP is low)
3. **Use Potion** - Restore 20 HP to your creature
4. **Run** - Try to escape (50% chance)

## Creatures

Choose your starter from three types:
- **Flameo** (Fire) - Balanced stats
- **Aquabit** (Water) - High HP, moderate attack
- **Leaflet** (Grass) - Good all-around stats

Wild creatures you can find:
- Sparky (Electric) - High attack
- Rockhead (Rock) - Very high HP

## Tips

1. **Visit the Healing House** often to restore your party
2. **Catch creatures** to build a strong party (max 6)
3. **Low HP = higher catch rate** - weaken creatures before catching
4. **The Boss is tough** - catch multiple creatures before challenging it
5. **You can't lose permanently** - if all creatures faint, you respawn at the healing house

## Winning the Game

Reach the Boss area (`B`) and defeat the MEGA DRAGON to win!

## Items

- **Pokeballs** - Catch wild creatures (start with 5, refill at healing house)
- **Potions** - Heal 20 HP in battle (start with 3, refill at healing house)

Good luck, trainer!
